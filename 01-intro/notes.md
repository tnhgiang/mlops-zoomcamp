# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is MLOps

`MLOps`, short for Machine Learning Operations, refers to the practices, methodologies, and tools used to streamline and operate the lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models. It aims to bridge the gap between data scientists, who develop and train models, and production environments, where models are deployed and maintained.

Traditionally, the development and deployment of ML models have been treated as separate stages, leading to challenges when transitioning from experimentation to production. MLOps seeks to address these challenges by introducing a set of best practices for managing ML workflows, collaboration, and automation.

By adopting MLOps practices, organizations can enhance the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of their ML deployments. It promotes a systematic approach to managing ML models, accelerates time to market, and facilitates collaboration between different stakeholders involved in ML development and deployment.

## 1.2 Steps in Machine Learning Project

1. Design: Do we need to use machine learning model to solve the problems?
2. Model: Train and optimize the model.
3. Operate: Model deployment, management and monitoring.

## 1.2 Environment

- Install python package manager: Anaconda, poetry, pyenv, ...
- Docker
